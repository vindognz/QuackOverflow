# QuackOverflow

A wirelessly-charged LED rubber duck for debugging. Custom PCB with RGB LEDs and rechargeable battery fits inside a Kmart duck. Charges on a 3D-printed "DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS" stand. Because explaining your code to a glowing duck is more fun than regular rubber duck debugging.

## Features
- 5x RGB LEDs
- Wireless Qi charging
- Auto-sleep when on charging pad
- Low battery warning (red flash)
- Custom PCB fits inside $2 Kmart duck

## Hardware
- ESP32-C3 microcontroller
- WS2812B RGB LEDs
- LiPo battery with Qi charging
- Custom PCB
- 3D printed charging base

## The Story
Rubber duck debugging is a real technique where programmers explain their code line-by-line to an inanimate object (traditionally a rubber duck) to help spot bugs. I was gifted this duck as a coding companion for my birthday. I always imagined it glowing for those 2am debugging sessions. This project aims to make that dream a reality.
